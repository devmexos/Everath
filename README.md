# Everath

A BEP-20 token with a thought for investors.
It uses an innovative Smart Anti-Dump System controlled by oracles.

The oracle constantly checks maximum prices and supports. If a price drop of more than a considerable percentage over the price of the last ATH is identified, the "Permanence Award" system is activated, which applies a higher tax to sales in that period and the resulting charge is fully distributed to the holders.
Once the price of the last ATH is reached again, this protection system is deactivated, so that holders always sell with a view to obtaining real benefits.
